# Wormhole attack NS3
The 'Wormhole-NS3' project is a simulation of wormhole attacks in wireless networks, developed using the ns-3 network simulator version 3.30. This version of ns-3 provides the necessary tools and models to accurately simulate such attacks, where malicious nodes create a virtual tunnel to disrupt network routing.
